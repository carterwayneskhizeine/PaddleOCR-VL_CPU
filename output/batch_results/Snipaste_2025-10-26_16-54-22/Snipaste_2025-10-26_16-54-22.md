# Types of Constants

const int CONSTANT_NAME = 50;

☑ You must initialize a constant.

● Literal Constants: Temporary & not stored in the same way that we store variables.

We cannot assign (write) to a constant - the value that it is initialized to will persist.

cout << 55 << endl; //55 is a literal constant

## ☑ Declared Constants:

☑ Constants have names/identifiers and are stored in memory just like variables.

We use the keyword const to declare a constant (const instructs the compiler to make the variable'read-only').
